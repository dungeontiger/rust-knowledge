# Introduction
This is a collection of Rust knowledge. 

As I learn Rust I wanted a permanent location to record the knowledge.  I liked the mdbook format so
decided to use that.

Why another reference for Rust information when there is so much out there? I do not find the Rust
documentation sufficient. I had to spend a lot of time with trial and error to get many things to work.
Of then the examples are very simple and I had a hard time extrapolating to a more complex real work case.

The things I learned that I felt need to be recorded are included here.
